**Understanding the Spectrum:**

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by differences in social communication, restricted and repetitive behaviors, and sensory sensitivities. These challenges can manifest in various ways, impacting each child differently. Identifying these unique needs is crucial for designing an effective therapy plan.
